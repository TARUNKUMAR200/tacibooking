"This is a taxi booking project using Python to build it. In this project, we can choose the destination, and it displays the fare according to the chosen place. We use various built-in Python library functions in this project. Additionally, we utilize SQL databases to store all the data. There are three payment options available to settle the bills: ATM card payment and UPI Payment. This project is very useful for understanding Python projects."
